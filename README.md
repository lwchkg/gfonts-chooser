# Google Fonts Chooser

While [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) is a great resource for fonts,
its website appears not the best place to browse its collection. That is why
_Google Fonts Chooser_ exists.

## Using the app

1. Click to select a font in the left sidebar. The font is now used in the main
   text.

2. If the font is
   a [Variable Font](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/introducing_type/introducing_variable_fonts),
   sliders are available for you to test drive the Variable Font features.

3. Switch between light and dark modes, and change the font size to see how the
   font looks in different environments. (_Note: DO NOT skip this step._)

4. You can filter the font list by selecting ‘Variable Fonts only’ and/or
   choosing one of the five categories.

## About fonts that comes without bold and italic styles

Not every font has bold, italic or bold italic styles. Faux-bold and
faux-italics are disabled in this app to make the absence of font styles more
visible.

The weight of the text you set is for normal text. For bold text, the app
increase the weight by 300, or set the weight to the maximum if adding 300 is
not possible. In the latter case, the bold text becomes less distinguishable, or
not distinguishable at all.
